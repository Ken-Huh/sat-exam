In contrast, a peaking hydroelectric power plant (used when demand for electricity peaks) controls the flow of water through its generators: starting flow when demand is high enough, stopping it when demand is too low, and otherwise regulating it to keep pace with changing electricity needs. Although peaking plants do not typically operate continuously as run-of-river plants do, peaking plants can generate more megawatt-hour of power per year (MWh/yr) than some run-of-river plants.
