One way that young orangutans acquire foraging skills is through a behavior scientists call peering—closely watching older orangutans. Since male orangutans typically leave the area of their birth upon maturity and females do not, Beatrice Ehmann and her colleagues hypothesized that it is more advantageous for immature males than females to devote attention to orangutans who are immigrants to the home region of the immature individual.`,
