I was too tired to fall all the way asleep, and even though Mamou was soft and warm, leaning up against her wasn't a terribly comfortable position to sleep in. So I dozed and floated on the clouds of Persian that blew my way from the front seat of Dayi (Uncle) Jamsheed's SUV. It reminded me of when I was little, and Mom chanted to me in Farsi every night before bedtime. It's hard to describe Farsi chanting: the way Mom drew her voice out like the notes of a cello as she recited poems by Rumi or Hafiz. I didn't know what they meant, but that didn't matter. It was quiet and soothing.`,

In a study, data scientist Sam K. Hui found that this effect can also be achieved with a less obvious cue: rearranging a store's layout. The researchers explain that trying to find items in new locations causes shoppers to move through more of the store, exposing them to more products and increasing the likelihood that they'll buy an item they hadn't planned on purchasing.`,

Alegado and colleagues reviewed data from many studies about how S. rosetta responds when exposed to another type of single-celled organism, bacteria, including Ingrid Brettar's work with Acinetobacter balticum bacteria and Jung-Chun Choi's work with Croceibacter atlanticus bacteria. Alegado and colleagues concluded that neither A. balticum nor C. atlanticus are likely to have played a significant role in the development of multicellular organisms.`,

It is common for freshwater lakes near or above a latitude of 45° north of the equator to accumulate surface ice in winter. The amount and duration of ice depends on many factors, including local weather conditions as well as the lake's depth, volume, and surface area, but climate researchers claim that some high-latitude lakes have seen a decline in the duration of ice between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s.`,
