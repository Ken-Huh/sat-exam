I walked slowly beneath the young leaves, drinking in the air, fragrant with the odor of young buds and sap. I sauntered along, forgetful of musty papers, of the offices, of my chief, my colleagues, my documents, and thinking of the good things that were sure to come to me, of all the veiled unknown contained in the future. A thousand recollections of childhood came over me, awakened by these country odors, and I walked along, permeated with the fragrant, living enchantment, the emotional enchantment of the woods warmed by the sun of June.`,

      passage: `Marrakech has high pedestrian traffic, but simply replicating a feature of Marrakech associated with walkability—e.g., its highly varied streetscape—may be insufficient to induce increased walking in other cities. As urbanist Mariela Alfonzo argues, our understanding of individuals' decision-making about whether to walk is insufficiently robust: some studies emphasize the role of demographic characteristics, others the role of public transit availability, and so on, but walking decisions are made in complex contexts in which multiple conditions and needs inform individuals' choices.`,
